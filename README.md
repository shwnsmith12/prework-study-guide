## Description

I used this project to learn new skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitFlow. I wanted to learn these skills because I am looking to make a career change, and I believe this is the first step to achieving that goal. This project taught me how to make a basic text website, and while there were hickups along the way, I definitely believe I've learned some building blocks.
